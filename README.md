# OpenWeatherMapApi

DESCRIPTION:
A testing framework for the Open Weather Map api (current weather). 4 POJO classes were created for 4 different types of JSON responses.
It allows for testers to write automated tests on the testbed which saves time and therefore cost compared to testing manually.

USAGE:
The user should clone the repo and checkout the Master Branch. Once in the branch, the user should head to the Test package and open the correct Testing API e.g TestRectangleDTO. 
Then, further tests could be written to test the specific parts that the user wants.

TESTING: 
The JSON Response and the Headers should be and have been tested.
The 4 POJO can be and have been tested.
The 4 DTO responses could not be tested.
